# html-emails-project
<p align="center">
Html emails for the marketing campaign, newsletters, announcements, sales etc. Templates will be displayed as a web page, in order to send them it is neccessary to convert css into inline style css.(Some of them are made from the scratch, for some of them I used and modified templates available on www.Mailchimp.com or used their html-email builder). This project should demonstrate my ability to build html-emails for marketing campaigns and it is part of my developer portfolio. All html-emails are for personal use not commercial, links are fake and companies are clones or fictional.</p>

Please note that these emails are displayed in the website view(desktop version for presentation only), some of them need to be modified by stripping <style> tag and it is neccessary to add inline tags and special tags in order to be send as an html-email.(All e-mails tested on Gmail, large desktop, laptop, tablet, and small screen such a i-phone 5 and 6. Unfortunately I have no access to email on acid so in order to make them fully responsive for MSO they need to be slightly adjusted.)</p>
