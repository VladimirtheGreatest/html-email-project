# html-emails-project
Html emails for the marketing campaign, newsletters, announcements, sales etc. Templates will be displayed as a web page, in order to send them it is neccessary to convert css into inline style css.(Some of them are made from the scratch, for some of them I used and modified templates available on www.Mailchimp.com or used their html-email builder). This project should demonstrate my ability to build html-emails for marketing campaigns and it is part of my developer portfolio. All html-emails are for personal use not commercial, links are fake and companies are clones or fictional. Images taken from www.unsplash.com or from the actual newsletters.

Please note that these emails are displayed in the website view(desktop version for presentation only), some of them need to be modified by stripping <style> tag and it is neccessary to add inline tags and special tags in order to be send as an html-email. I tested them on large desktop, laptop, tablet, and small screen such a i-phone 5 and 6.
