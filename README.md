# html-emails-project
Html emails for the marketing campaign, newsletters, announcements, sales etc. Templates will be displayed as a web page, in order to send them it is neccessary to convert css into inline style css.(Some of them are made from the scratch, for some of them I used and modified templates available on www.Mailchimp.com). This project should demonstrate my ability to build html-emails for marketing campaigns and it is part of my developer portfolio. All html-emails are for personal use not commercial, links are fake and companies are clones or fictional. Images taken from www.unsplash.com
